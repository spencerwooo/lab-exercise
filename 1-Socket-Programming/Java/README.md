# Project 1 - Socket Programming

## Target

Student will write a TCP or UDP client and a TCP or UDP server. Implement a client that retrieves temperature, humidity and light data from a remote server. The client should connect to the server, stay connected, and retrieve a number of readings. The client can request readings from the server as many times as you want.

The server is responsible for accepting client connections and sending out the right data according to the commands sent by clients.

Data returned by the server are like:

```
TEMPERATURE = 60    HUMIDITY = 0    LIGHT = 1
```
