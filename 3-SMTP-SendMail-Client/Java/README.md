# Project 3 - SMTP SendMail Client

## Target

SMTP Client encapsulates all the functionality necessary to send mail through an SMTP server. You must first connect to the server with TCP port 25. Before doing anything, and finally disconnect after you're completely finished interacting with the server. Once you setup a TCP connection, you can interactive with SMTP server using SMTP commands. The convention for all the SMTP command methods in SMTP Client is such that they must return a boolean value or some other value.
