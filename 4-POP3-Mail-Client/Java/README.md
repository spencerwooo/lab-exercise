# Project4 - POP3 Mail Client

## Target

POP3 Client encapsulates all the functionality necessary to receive mail from a POP3 server. You must first connect to the server with TCP port 110. Before doing anything, and finally disconnect after you're completely finished interacting with the server. Once you setup a TCP connection, you can interactive with POP3 server using POP3 commands. The convention for all the POP3 command methods in POP3 Client is such that they must return a boolean value or some other value.
